# BTT-Practical

A complete Macbook Pro Touch Bar overhaul, focused on a clean, minimalistic
design for those interested in hardware stats, essential developer tools and
quick and intuitive shortcuts. 

This runs on BetterTouchTool, which can be purchased [here](https://folivora.ai/buy). 

# Installation
In order to get certain system information that is displayed on the Touch Bar,
you will need to install some `brew` and `gem` packages. If you aren't a 
developer, don't worry, it's all handled for you in the `requirements.sh` file. However, if you aren't a developer, you will still have to install the `XCode Developer Tools`, which will take up about 4GB of storage and may require a password. 

To install, open `Terminal.app`, and paste the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/jlehrer1/BTT-Practical.git
cd BTT-Practical/
chmod +x requirements.sh
./requirements.sh
cd ..
rm -rf BTT-Practical
```
