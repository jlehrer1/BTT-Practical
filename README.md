A BetterTouchTool preset focused on a clean, minimalistic design for those interested in hardware stats and essential developer tools. 

Required packages:
In order to get certain system information that is displayed on the Touch Bar,
you will need to install some `brew` and `gem` packages. If you aren't a 
developer, don't worry, it's all handled in the `requirements.sh`. 

Installation instructions:  
Open `Terminal.app`, and paste the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/jlehrer1/BTT-Practical.git
cd BTT-Practical/
chmod +x requirements.sh
./requirements.sh
